## Project Overview

This project is a same-day, no-cost MVP called **p0r by Louda**.

Tagline: **Build Landing Page with AI**

The app lets a user describe a business, product, service, startup idea, personal brand, student project, freelancer offer, or local business. It uses AI to generate structured landing page content and turns that content into a polished one-page website preview with deterministic graphics, then exports a complete standalone `index.html`.

The final output is a complete standalone `index.html` the user can copy or download and open directly in a browser.

This is not a full website builder.
This is not a SaaS dashboard.
This is not a drag-and-drop editor.

## Main Goal

Build a clean, working, deployed MVP that can be shared today.

The MVP must let the user:

1. Fill out a short form about a business or idea.
2. Optionally upload a logo (client-side only).
3. Choose 3 brand colors and a light/dark generated-site theme.
4. Optionally provide up to 3 photo URLs.
5. Generate structured landing page content using OpenRouter.
6. Preview the generated landing page with deterministic graphics.
7. Copy the generated HTML.
8. Download the website as `index.html`.
9. Open the downloaded file directly in a browser.

## Tech Stack

Use:

* Next.js
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* shadcn/ui
* OpenRouter API
* HY3/free OpenRouter model if available
* Vercel free tier

Free tools and free tiers only.

Avoid:

* Paid APIs
* Paid databases
* Paid templates
* Paid UI kits
* Paid assets
* Paid hosting
* AI image generation

## Hard Scope Rules

Do not build:

* Auth
* Database
* Dashboard
* Payments
* Drag-and-drop editor
* Custom domains
* User hosting
* Saved projects
* User accounts
* Team accounts
* Complex template systems
* Multiple unnecessary pages
* Section-by-section editor
* Full website builder functionality
* AI image generation
* External image APIs (Unsplash, Pexels, etc.)
* Logo storage or upload to a server

The priority is a working deployed product, not a large feature set.

## Product Principle

The AI generates **structured content only**.

Do not ask the AI to generate:

* React components
* Next.js pages
* Raw HTML
* CSS
* Random layouts
* External image URLs
* Image API calls

The app owns:

* Layout
* Styling
* Preview rendering
* HTML export
* Logo rendering (data URL)
* Color system
* Theme system
* Deterministic graphics
* Copy behavior
* Download behavior

Pipeline:

```txt
User form + design input
→ Server-side OpenRouter call (text only)
→ Structured JSON content
→ Parse and normalize response
→ Render React preview (with logo, colors, theme, graphics)
→ Generate standalone HTML string
→ Copy or download index.html
```

## Required Form Fields

Short form:

* Business/product name
* What it does
* Target audience
* Main problem it solves
* Main benefit
* Tone
* Primary call-to-action
* Optional offer/pricing
* Optional contact info

Tone options: Clear and practical, Friendly and casual, Professional and direct, Premium but not hypey, Student project style, Local business style.

## Design Input

```ts
type LandingPageDesignInput = {
  logoDataUrl?: string
  primaryColor: string
  secondaryColor: string
  accentColor: string
  siteTheme: "dark" | "light"
  photoUrls: string[]
  useLogoPalette: boolean
}
```

Rules:

* Logo upload is client-side only; converted to a data URL; never sent to a server.
* 3 manual brand colors (primary, secondary, accent) affect the generated site.
* Theme (dark/light) controls only the generated site, not the builder app UI.
* Up to 3 optional photo URLs. Invalid URLs must not crash the app.
* Optional logo palette extraction: sample the uploaded logo on a canvas, extract up to 3 colors, let the user override manually. Fail gracefully.
* If no photo URLs are provided, show deterministic generated graphics instead.

## Required AI Output Shape

```ts
export type LandingPageContent = {
  brandName: string
  tagline: string
  heroHeadline: string
  heroSubheadline: string
  primaryCTA: string
  secondaryCTA: string
  problemTitle: string
  problemDescription: string
  solutionTitle: string
  solutionDescription: string
  benefits: string[]
  features: {
    title: string
    description: string
  }[]
  faqs: {
    question: string
    answer: string
  }[]
  pricingOrOffer: string
  contactText: string
  footerText: string
  imageSuggestions?: string[]
  photoKeywords?: string[]
}
```

The AI returns JSON only. No markdown, code fences, explanations, HTML, or React. `imageSuggestions`/`photoKeywords` are optional and must NOT be used to fetch images.

## AI Copywriting Rules

Specific, practical, clear, useful, simple, relevant, non-hypey. Avoid: innovative, revolutionary, game-changing, next-level, seamless, cutting-edge, world-class, powerful solution, transform your business, unlock your potential. Do not invent fake testimonials, awards, numbers, case studies, guarantees.

## OpenRouter Rules

Server-side only.

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_MODEL=tencent/hy3:free
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

* Never expose the API key to the client.
* No `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
* Client calls a local server endpoint; server calls OpenRouter.
* Model configurable via `OPENROUTER_MODEL`; default `tencent/hy3:free`.
* No image generation calls; no other providers.

## Parsing and Normalization

Implement `parseAiJson`, `normalizeLandingPageContent`, `ensureStringArray`, `ensureFeatureArray`, `ensureFaqArray`. Normalize missing fields, keep arrays safe, prevent preview crashes on partial output.

## Deterministic Graphics

Generated site includes built-in graphics created with CSS, inline SVG, HTML, gradients, borders, shadows, and pseudo-layouts. No external dependencies.

Use: abstract hero visual, gradient mesh/card, orb/glow shapes, monochrome grid background, product-style mock card, feature cards with icon-like shapes, decorative SVG lines, simple geometric blocks, branded visual panel using selected colors.

Graphics adapt to primary/secondary/accent colors, light/dark theme, optional logo, and optional photo URLs. If photo URLs are provided, show them; otherwise show deterministic graphics.

## HTML Export Rules

Exported website must be: complete HTML document, single file `index.html`, responsive, styled with embedded CSS, usable opened directly in a browser, free of external scripts/CSS/frameworks/required images.

`generateStandaloneHtml(content, design): string` supports logo data URL, selected colors, light/dark theme, optional photo URLs, and deterministic graphics. All user/AI content escaped via `escapeHtml`. No raw AI HTML. No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for the app preview.

## Preview Rules

React preview using structured content + design. Includes header with logo if provided, hero with abstract graphic or photo, CTA buttons, problem, solution, benefits, features, visual/graphics section, optional photo grid, FAQ, offer/contact CTA, footer. Polished, modern, screenshot-friendly.

## UI Design Rules

shadcn/ui components: Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Card, Badge, Separator, Skeleton (Sonner optional).

Builder app: dark, mostly monochrome, minimal, crisp, spacious, strong typography, clean cards, clear hierarchy, v0-style. Brand colors affect the generated site, not the builder UI.

## State Requirements

Empty state, validation errors, loading state (disable Generate, show preview skeleton + "Generating landing page...", optional staged labels), API error, JSON parse error, generated preview, copied state, disabled export before content exists. Keep state simple, no global store.

## Example Presets

Local coffee shop, Freelance web design service, Student study app, Beginner fitness tracker. Fill the form instantly, remain editable.

## Vercel Deployment Notes

Push to GitHub, import into Vercel, add env vars (OPENROUTER_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_MODEL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL), redeploy, test generation, download index.html, open locally, screenshot.

## Development Philosophy

Keep the app small. Prefer boring, reliable code. Prioritize working generation, preview, export, deployment, clean UI. Do not overbuild.

Goal: ship a useful AI tool today, not a full platform.

## Generated Website Quality v2

The generated/exported landing page was redesigned to look premium, not like a basic skeleton.

### Design direction

* One strong deterministic template (no multi-template system).
* `max-width: 1200px` container, generous section spacing via `clamp()`.
* Hero with `clamp()` headline (~40–76px), eyebrow, subheadline, dual CTA, trust strip, and a layered abstract hero graphic or photo.
* Problem/Solution editorial two-panel split.
* Benefits grid (up to 4 cards with numbered marks).
* Features as a bento grid with varied card sizes on desktop and SVG line glyphs.
* Showcase section: premium photo grid when photo URLs exist, otherwise deterministic browser mockup / generated graphics.
* FAQ as a clean numbered list (no JS).
* Strong closing CTA band using brand color glow.
* Clean footer.

### Color and logo rules

* Colors are optional. `LandingPageDesignInput.colorsCustomized` distinguishes user-set colors from defaults.
* Color priority: (1) manual user colors when `colorsCustomized`, (2) logo-extracted palette when `useLogoPalette` and a logo exists, (3) curated default palette for the chosen theme.
* Curated dark/light base palettes define surfaces, borders, glows, text, and contrast. Brand/user/logo color is applied with restraint to CTA, glows, icons, and highlights only.
* Logo upload (client-side data URL) extracts a 3-color palette via canvas and sets it as the default generated-site palette (`useLogoPalette`), overridable manually. Extraction fails gracefully to the curated palette.
* `themeVars()` in `lib/generated-site.ts` resolves the active palette; `resolvePalette()` implements the priority.

### Graphics (deterministic, no external assets)

* Hero art: layered glow, dot grid, floating cards, orb, ring.
* Browser mockup for showcase when no photos.
* 12 SVG line glyphs for features (`FEATURE_ICONS`), shared between preview and export.
* All graphics use CSS variables, adapt to theme, and are duplicated in preview and export.

### Files

* `lib/generated-site.ts`: `themeVars`, `resolvePalette`, `GENERATED_SITE_CSS`, `heroArtHtml`, `showcaseGraphicHtml`, `featureGlyphSvg`, `FEATURE_ICONS`.
* `lib/html-export.ts`: `generateStandaloneHtml()` uses the new 10-section layout.
* `components/landing-preview.tsx`: React mirror of the export using identical class names.
* `components/generator-form.tsx`: color fields marked optional; manual edits set `colorsCustomized`; logo upload derives default palette.

### Acceptance for v2

* Colors optional; logo optional; no-logo/no-color exports still look good.
* Logo upload drives default palette; user can override.
* Preview and exported `index.html` match and look significantly better.
* Light and dark themes both look premium.
* `npm run build` passes; no secrets committed.
